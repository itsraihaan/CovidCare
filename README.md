# CovidCare
I developed this DBMS website using Python

In 2020-21, the world has gone through a global pandemic. The
novel coronavirus disease had widespread across the globe,
affecting millions of people and leaving hundreds of thousand of
people dead. The hospitals in the country had a great challenge
managing the COVID-19 positive patients and at one point went
out of control. We would like to make a database software that
would help in hospital management. This project mainly deals with
the patient entry in the software, also allotting beds to the
respective patients.
 We are designing a software that mainly communicates with three
sections. First one is the ‘admin’, who is going to administer the
software, give the respective ID’s to the hospitals and maintain the
overall software. The second section is for the hospitals. For the
hospitals to login or sign up to the software, the admin has to
authenticate and provide the hospital ID to the email provided by
the hospital which would allow the hospitals to enter their details.
The third section belongs to the user or the patient who is tested
positive for the disease. The patient has to first register himself/
herself to the software by the SRFID which is given to them during
the RT-PCR tests. The user can sign up and enter their information
and medical records in the software( the hospital management can
access these records ). The user will have an option as “book a
bed”, which will allow the patient to look at the available beds and
choose one according to his personal and medical convenience.
This is how we aim this database software can help both, the
hospitals and patients in better management.
